        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Dany and i am a student at <abbr title="Algonquin College">AC</abbr> in Ottawa. I like learning business, design, and technology because they connect to real life and 
            the 21 <sup>st</sup> typa workarea. I try to <em>stay focused</em> on my studies,
             keep things simple, and imporve a little each day.
             School can be challenging, but i like working step by step to finish my tasks.
        </p>

            Outside of school i enjoy going to the gym taking nature walks and spending time with my friends.
            I like trying new hobbies such as photography and coding.
            My main goal is to build a career that mixes business and creativity.
            I also want to gain skills that will help me get a good job in the future and 
            allow me to grow as a person. Keeping balance between school and life is important to me.
