                <p> 
                    Hello, my names Dany Roy Barakat and im a student at Algonquin College in
                    2025. I try to <em>stay focused</em> on my studies,
                    keep things simple, and improve a little each day. School can be 
                    challenging, but i like working step by step to finish my tasks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of school i enjoy going to the gym, taking nature walks, 
                    and spending time with my friends. i like trying new things such
                    as photography and coding. My main goal is to build a career that
                    mixes business and creativity.
                </p>
