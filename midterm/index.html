    The red fox is one of the most well-known animals in the world. It has bright orange fur, sharp eyes, and a long fluffy tail that people often call a brush. 
    Red foxes live in many places such as forests, fields, mountains, and even near towns and cities. They are fast runners and can leap high into the air when hunting. 
    Their diet is very flexible, which is one reason they can survive in so many different places. They eat small animals like rabbits and mice, but also insects, fruits, and berries. 
    At night, a fox may curl up and use its tail to stay warm, especially in the winter. Foxes are also very clever and will hide food in the ground to save it for later. 
    They are playful animals, sometimes chasing each other or playing with objects they find. Red foxes are found across North America, Europe, and Asia, and people have also brought them to Australia. 
    They make many different sounds, from short barks to high screams, and scientists believe they can make over forty types of calls. This helps them talk with each other in the wild. 
    Because of their bright color, smart habits, and curious nature, red foxes are often seen as a symbol of cleverness in stories and culture around the world.
